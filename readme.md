### BioinformaticsContest2021

I participated in the [Bioinformatics Contest 2021](https://bioinf.me/en/contest/2021) (competitor "Maksim Nesterenko", 167 place) and my solving of problems is here.
Final scoring for the contest: [http://mon.stepik.org/2021/](http://mon.stepik.org/2021/).

During the contest (24 hours) I have found some solution for most of the problems. My methods work, but it is far from optimal solution (it is slow in some cases or get not maximal score). After the competition, I did small optimization, polishing of my code and push it here (without changing in main idea of solution that I have found).

**Qualification round**

- Q1 - <span style="color:green">all solved</span>
- Q2 - <span style="color:green">all solved</span>
- Q3 - <span style="color:orange">partial solution</span> (for levels 1, 2, 3, 4 the solution can be found in a reasonable time - less 24 hours; 5, 6, 7 - solution can be found in some days of calculations)

**Final round**
- F1 - <span style="color:orange">partial solution</span> (for all levels the solution can be found in a short time, all solutions give about 50 % of maximal score for this problem)
- F2 - <span style="color:orange">partial solution</span> (level 1 completely solved, answers for 2-4 give about 50 % of maximal score for this problem, hard version is missed)
- F3 - <span style="color:green">all solved</span> (levels 4, 5, 6, 7 can take some time)
- F4 - <span style="color:red">missed</span>
- F5 - <span style="color:orange">partial solution</span> (levels 1-5 completely solved, calculating level 6 takes a lot of time, hard version is missed)
